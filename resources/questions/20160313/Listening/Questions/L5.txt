3.Why does the professor mention the Moon's size?
A)To explain how scientists determined the composition of the Moon
B)To explain how scientists determined when the Moon was formed
C)To explain why scientists believed the Moon could never have had a molten core
D)To explain why scientists believed the Moon and Earth's core were formed through similar processes

4.Why does the professor discuss meteorites and asteroids?
A)To explain how some scientists thought lunar rocks became magnetized
B)To provide details of how the Moon was formed
C)To explain unusual geologic formations on some parts of the Moon

5.What did scientists learn about the "troctoÂ¡"?
A)It is the youngest Moon rock collected to date.
B)It had been in a magnetic environment for millions of years.
C)It was probably not formed through the solidification of molten iron.
D)It was most likely magnetized by an impact with a large object.

6.What is the professor's opinion of the lunar dynamo theory?

B)He is concerned that it does not explain irregularities in some Moon rocks.
C)He thinks it contradicts a widely accepted hypothesis regarding the Moon's origin.
D)He believes there is enough evidence to justify further research.
