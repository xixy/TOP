As you know there are plants that bear fruit. The seeds of the plant are contained in the fruit. And so, in order for a plant to reproduce in new areas, its fruit needs to be distributed to new areas. Ok, now certain kinds of fruit have special physical features that enable them to be transported away from the parent plant in order for the plant's seeds to be distributed through locations. So, let's look at a couple of features that fruits can have that help them to transport seeds to locations. Some types of fruit have a feature that causes them to stick to animal's fur so when an animal comes into contact with the fruit, the fruit attaches itself to the animal's fur, then the animal walks on and eventually the fruit gets deposited in some new location. For example, there's a plant called the burdock. The fruit of the burdock plant has a little hook-like feature that helps it hook onto and stick to the fur of passing animals until it eventually falls off at some new locations. That's helping to spread the seeds of the burdock plant. Ok, and other types of fruit have a feature that enables the seed to float in water. So, if the seed falls into the water, the water can transport the fruit to a new location. A good example are coconuts. Look at the fruit of the coconut palm tree which often grow into the ocean. Coconuts have a thick wooden covering so the coconut can float in the water. So when coconuts fall off a palm tree, they can float away in the ocean which helps disperse the palm tree seeds sometimes hundreds or even thousands of miles away.
