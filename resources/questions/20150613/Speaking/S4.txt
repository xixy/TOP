Enclothed Cognition 
Researchers have known for some time that wearing a particular kind of clothing can affect how people perceive themselves. Recently, however, researchers have discovered that clothing may affect more than just how we feel about ourselves. The clothes people wear may also change their ability to process information and perform tasks, a phenomenon known as enclothed cognition. Certain clothing can have a particular meaning or association, and wearing this clothing may cause people to think and act in a way that reflects this association.

Ok, so scientists did an experiment which demonstrated how this works. The study used long white lab coats just like medical doctors wear here in the US. Now, what traits do we associate with doctors? For one thing, we know they are observant. They need to pay attention to detail so researchers wanted to see if people who weren’t medical doctors would show this behavior while wearing lab coats. Here's what they did. They got two groups of volunteers and in one of the groups, each of the volunteers was given a lab coat to wear. And in the other group, each volunteer was just shown a lab coat. It was put on the table in front of them and they were told to look at it. And in each case, of course, the volunteers were told that these were doctors’ lab coats. So, to test their ability, the volunteers had to look at two pictures that were almost the same, but not quite. Then the participants had to see how many differences they could notice between the two pictures. And here's the interesting thing: the people who were wearing the doctors’ lab coats noticed more differences than the people who just looked at the lab coats. So the researchers concluded that by actually wearing the lab coats, people started to act like doctors. To be more observant and better at noticing small details.
