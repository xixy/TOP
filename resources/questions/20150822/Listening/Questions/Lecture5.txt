B.	It is likely to be of a medium body size.
C.	It will tend to avoid areas with multiple colors and patterns.
D.	It will most likely be found close to a seashore.

B.	They display irregularly shaped dark and light patches.
C.	They display a disruptive coloration to match the local environment.
D.	They quickly swim away from the gravel patch.

4.	What features of disruptive crypsis does the professor mention?
Click on 2 answers.
A.	It disguises the outline of the animal that uses it.
B.	It works by contrasting with the colors in the surrounding habitat.
C.	It is most effective when used against a single-colored background.
D.	It can incorporate a combination of other crypsis patterns.

5.	Why does the professor mention the tiger?
A.	To illustrate that the results of the cephalopod research can be extended to many other animals
B.	To give an example of an animal whose crypsis strategy has been extensively studied
C.	To point out how different its crypsis strategy is from the strategy used by smaller animals
D.	To argue that predators rely on crypsis less than prey species do
