Prescribed burning is a tool used in forests and wildlife preserves across North America and Australia. In a prescribed burn, fire-management workers intentionally set fire to part of a forest and let the fire burn under supervision until it dies out naturally. Supporters of prescribed burns claim that the practice of setting regular, controlled fires decreases the likelihood and severity of natural forest fires. However, opponents point out that this benefit is not worth the dangers that result from prescribed burning.

First, prescribed burns pose a threat to wildlife in the forest where the burn is being conducted. Birds, deer, and other animals may become trapped in the fire and die. This is especially true if there are nestlings, young birds that are not yet ready to leave their nest, or any type of young mammal that is too undeveloped to run quickly; such creatures would not be able to escape, even if a mature animal could.

Second, as all fires do, prescribed burns release smoke that pollutes the atmosphere. Smoke from fires contains carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that can trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, and chemicals in the smoke can contribute to acid rain and other forms of pollution. Furthermore, winds may carry the harmful chemicals to areas far away from the actual fire. In this way, prescribed burns increase pollution levels.

Third, in many areas where prescribed burns are used, natural fires still break out and cause damage. So after spending the money, time, and resources to perform a prescribed burn, firefighters and residents may have to spend additional money, time, and resources fighting the natural fires that prescribed burns failed to prevent.
