Now listen to part of a lecture in an Environmental Science class. The professor is discussing plants.

(female professor) So what happens when a new plant species gets introduced into a particular environment, like a species of tree introduced for the first time into a particular forest, or a species of plant introduced into an area for agricultural purposes, or just by accident? Well, the fact is the introduction of new plant species can have very serious effects. These plants can modify or damage an otherwise stable ecosystem. They can substantially alter an ecosystem’s balance of resources and this ultimately affects native plants.

Take the acacia tree. It was intentionally brought to the coast of South Africa for a specific purpose. People thought the acacia tree would help stabilize shifting sand dunes, because it grows a system of long roots. It did help solve that problem, but, it created another. Its presence was bad for the vegetation natural to that area. The acacia grows taller than the rest of the plants, preventing them from getting enough sunlight. So native plants that once had plenty of exposure to the light they need now have a harder time surviving.

Uh, another example, the salt cedar tree, it was brought to the western US in the 1800s, probably because people found it attractive. But salt cedar trees are spreading so fast. Uh, they tend to live near water and what’s happening is, well, they’re spreading along streams at a rate about twelve miles a year. That’s a huge distance. They have really deep roots that soak up large amounts of water from rivers. Actually, they can use twice the amount of water that native trees use. Therefore, salt cedar trees leave many native species without the water they need to survive.

#question
Using the two examples from the lecture, explain how plants introduced from other places can affect native species.
