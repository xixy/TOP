(man) How's it going, Diana? Have you got your new apartment all set up?
(woman) Yeah, pretty much, my friend Max came over this weekend to help me with some of the final details like hanging pictures.
(man) Nice
(woman) Yeah, but there was a little accident and Max wound up breaking a window.
(man) Oh, no, how'd that happen?
(woman) Well, he was using a hammer to help me hang a picture on the wall right next to a window and somehow he dropped the hammer. When it fell from his hand, the hammer hit the window, which cracked the glass.
(man) Oh, wow, was he OK?
(woman) Oh, yes, Max was totally fine. And the window just cracked a little bit but it still needs to be replaced. 
(man) OK, well, that's too bad.
(woman) Yeah, when it happened, Max offered to pay for replacing it, which was nice of him. But I talked to the person who manages the apartment building today and he said it's gonna cost like a hundred dollars to replace that window.
(man) Wow! 
(woman) Yeah, so, I don't know. I could take Max up on his offer and like split the cost with him so we each pay fifty dollars.
(man) Sounds reasonable.
(woman) But, then, on the other hand, Max was there to being with to help me out. And it's not like he broke the window on purpose. It was just an accident.
(man) That is true.
(woman) Right, so maybe I should just cover the whole cost myself to replace the window. But it's a lot of money. I probably need to work a few extra hours at the grocery store this week to be able to do it.
