(female professor) OK, now, rather than renting a separate building for their business, many small business owners operate their business out of their homes. Running a business out of your home has some advantages. But it can also have some serious disadvantages, some serious drawbacks. Let’s look at a couple of these drawbacks.

One problem for home-based businesses is that it can be difficult to maintain a professional image. Since the business owners are running the business out of their homes, it may be difficult for them to establish clear boundaries between their business activities and their personal lives, so potential customers may not take the business seriously. For example, suppose someone runs a catering business out of their home, preparing food for big events like weddings. If a potential customer calls and hears a baby crying in the background, that customer may think the business owners are not professional and may not trust the business to provide food for their event.

Another problem for home-based businesses is that they can cause problems with the neighbors. Certain business activities may make the neighbors unhappy and they may complain to the business owner or even to the police. For example, back to the catering business, the business may have several workers who come to the owner’s house to help prepare the food. And these workers park their cars on the street. And then, the people who live in the neighborhood don’t have any place to park and they complain about it.
