Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.  A) In addition to meeting Caro and Hauser's criteria for teaching, the behavior demonstrated by meerkat helpers is time-consuming and requires great effort.  B) Experimental and observational data show that the behavior of meerkat helpers meets the first two requirements for teaching outlined by Caro and Hauser.  C) Thornton and McAuliffe observed that the amount of time and effort required by helpers depends upon the age of meerkats and environmental conditions.  D) Observations and experiments conducted upon meerkat helpers show that only two of Caro and Hauser's criteria are actually necessary for teaching to occur.11. The word "it" in the passage refers to  A) the teaching  B) the experiment  C) the observational data  D) the helpers' behavior12. In paragraph 4, why does the author discuss an additional experiment conducted by Thornton and McAuliffe?  A) To show that meerkats require extensive practice before they are able to forage on their own  B) To give an example of an experiment that suggested a new requirement for teaching  C) To argue that meerkats can be taught to forage in the research lab as well as in the wild  D) To provide evidence that meerkat behavior satisfies Caro and Hauser's third requirement of teaching13.Look at the four squares [ï‚¢] that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.   Eventually, even scorpions are presented to the pups without interference from the helpers.   Where would the sentence best fit?14. Prose Summary   To qualify as teaching, animal behavior must meet three requirements identified by Caro and Hauser.   Answer Choices:   A) Meerkat pups receive more training as a result of being raised by all members of the group, and that is why they learn to capture their own prey sooner than animals raised by the parents alone.   B) Some animals like domestic cats and cheetahs might be teaching their young to deal with prey, but there has been no investigation of whether learning from the adults actually takes place.   C) Researchers have found that teaching is most common among animals that must subdue difficult or dangerous prey, such as scorpions.   D) Experiments show that adult meerkats teach young pups to make a variety of different calls that serve to alert other meerkats to the presence of prey.   E) Meerkat helpers present pups with different types of prey as their skills increase, and they help ensure that prey does not escape before the pup can catch it.   F) Researchers have shown that meerkat teaching behavior occurs in the presence of inexperienced individuals, has immediate costs, and results in clear learning on the part of pupils.
