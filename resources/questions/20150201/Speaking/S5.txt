Male student: Hey Sue, did you get that internet connection installed in your new apartment yet?
Female student: No, actually, we were supposed to get it installed today. The guy from the internet company was supposed to come this afternoon and set it up so I waited around all afternoon but he never showed up. And then he called to say he needed to reschedule for tomorrow afternoon.
Male student: Oh, that's a pain.
Female student: Yeah, especially because tomorrow I have plans to go to the movies with friends in the afternoon.
Male student: Oh, great.
Female student: Yeah, and my roommate and I really need to get the internet connection tomorrow because we need to do research for some important assignments.
Male student: Hmm, well what about your roommate? Why don't you ask her to stay in your apartment and wait for the internet guy?
Female student: Yeah, she could, but she was planning to go to a study session tomorrow afternoon. A review session for a test she's got coming up in one of her classes. The session isn't required but she thinks it might help her for the test so she'd like to go.
Male student: Hmm.
Female student: But she said she'd be willing to skip the study session if I wanted her to.
Male student: Ok, so why don't you just do that? Ask her to wait for the internet guy
Female student: Well, I could, but I'd feel a little guilty about making her miss the study session so I'm thinking maybe I should just cancel my plans instead.
Male student: Not go to the movies?
Female student: Yeah.
Male student: But you stayed in your apartment all afternoon today, so tomorrow it should be her turn, right?
Female student: Yeah, that's true. And I was really looking forward to spending time with my friends. Hmm. I don't know.
