Online Tutoring for Math Students 

I think the university should consider creating an online tutoring system in math. Currently, students who want tutoring help in mathematics need to meet with the graduate students who do tutoring in the math building, but there are only a few tutors available and they are only there at certain times of the morning or afternoon. An online tutoring system would allow students to choose whatever times work best for them. Additionally, this should increase the number of tutors because more graduate students would probably volunteer to tutor if they could do the work online.
Sincerely, Jim Douglas

Man: Did you see this letter in the paper?
Woman: Yea, I did. I think it's a great idea. I mean, so many of us need this kind of help but it just isn’t convenient to set up an appointment there during the day because we have classes and part time jobs and other stuff to do.
Man: That is so true. 
Woman: So this would allow a lot more people to get help, especially in the evenings which is when most of us are free and actually have the time to work on our class assignments. 
Man: Sure. That makes real sense.
Woman: And the point about graduate students makes a lot of sense too. I mean, many of them live off campus in other towns, so it would be more convenient for them to work at home and not have to come to the campus.
Man: Yea I have a few friends who are getting graduate degrees and some of them have like a 40 minute drive to get here. They live pretty far away.
Woman: Right. So I think they’d be much more interested in a job if it didn’t involve them having to travel back and forth to the campus all the time to do it.
