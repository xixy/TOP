So, rainforests are warm and they get a lot of rainfall so they are a good place for plants to live. But the fact that rainforests get so much rain can also present challenges for plants because if a lot of water falls on the surface of a plant and stays there it can encourage the growth of harmful mold or bacteria that could kill the plant. So rainforest plants have special adaptations to prevent water from accumulating on their surfaces. One adaptation some rainforest plants have is they have a special coating on the outside of the plant and this coating repels rain water, forces the rainwater off the plant. For example, the leaves of many rainforest plants are coated in a waxy substance and when rain falls on the plant this waxy coating causes the rain to form droplets that then roll off the leaf so the rain water doesn‘t accumulate on the leaves. Another adaptation that helps prevent water from building up on rainforest plants is specially shaped leaves. The leaves of many rainforest plants are shaped in a way that causes water to run off them quickly so that the water doesn‘t get a chance to form puddles or build up on the leaves. For example, many rainforest plants have leaves that end in long, sharply pointed tips, called drip tips. And when water falls on one of these leaves it is immediately directed downward toward this tip on the end of the leaf where it drips off the leaf. So then the rainwater doesn‘t have a chance to accumulate on the plant‘s surface.
