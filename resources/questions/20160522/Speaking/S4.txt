Startle Defense

Over time, animal species have developed various defenses to avoid being attacked by other animals. Many animals defend themselves by remaining hidden and blending in with their surroundings. Some of these animals also protect themselves by using a startle defense. With this form of defense, an animal may startle or surprise an approaching predator by suddenly displaying a bright color and making a loud noise. While the predator is momentarily distracted by fear or surprise, the animal has time to quickly move to a new location and immediately conceal itself again.

Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a Biology class.

(male professor) So let’s look at an example of this. There’s an insect in North America, a type of grasshopper that does this. These grasshoppers live in grasslands and spend much of their time on the ground where they don’t usually stand out much. Their bodies are darkly colored with brown and gray markings, so they mostly just looked like the dirt all around them. They’re pretty hard to spot.

But if a bird happens to land in the grass near to one of these grasshoppers, a little too close for comfort, the grasshopper will quickly fly away. As soon as the grasshopper opens its wings to fly, it reveals its lower wings which are bright red, unlike the rest of the grasshopper’s brown and gray body. The grasshopper also makes a sharp clicking sound as it flies.

And while the bird’s trying to recover from seeing this flash of red and hearing a clicking sound, the grasshopper will just land somewhere further away in the grass and fold its wings back into place so they looked brown and gray again.

Explain how the example from the professor’s lecture illustrates the concept of startle defense.
