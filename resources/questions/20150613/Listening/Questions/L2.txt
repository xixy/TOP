C.	Moving a sculpture to make room for wind turbines
D.	The use of a large amount of campus land for engineering projects

3.	Why does the professor mention different wind speeds?
A.	To compare the efficiency of two different vertical axis turbine models
B.	To point out that vertical axis turbines work well in a variety of wind conditions
C.	To explain why propeller turbines require locations where extreme weather is common
D.	To argue against relying on wind power in certain regions

4.	According to the professor, what feature of propeller turbines makes them an undesirable choice for generating power for the university?

B.	Each turbine requires the installation of a special foundation.
C.	The turbines cannot be placed close together.
D.	Propeller turbines do not last as long as vertical axis wind turbines.

A.	It stimulated an idea about how to make some wind farms more efficient.
B.	It  prompted  engineers  to  make  changes  to  the  design  of  three-propeller turbines.
C.	It shows that marine life is harmed by wind farms that are located along the coastline.
D.	It explains why turbines are most efficient when they are all spinning in the same direction.
