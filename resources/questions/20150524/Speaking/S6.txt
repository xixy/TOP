A person who is in a group will think and behave differently than they would if they were alone. In particular, if most of the people in a group, uh, the majority think the same thing, then I, if I am in the group, will be effected by what the majority thinks. This is that is called majority influence. So, let's talk about two types of majority influence. Informational influence and normative influence. First there is informational influence. Now this happens when what is important to you is information: getting the right answer to a question. Say you are driving a car taking a group of people to a restaurant. Now at one point you’re not sure which way to go. You think you need to turn left, but when you ask the people in the car everyone says “go straight”. Do you turn left? No, you don’t. Since the majority thinks you should go straight, that's probably correct. You change what you think is the correct answer and go straight. This is informational influence. Then there is normative influence. Normative influence occurs when a person wants to be accepted by a group. To gain approval the person goes along with the norm, the popular opinion. Say you go to a movie with some people you are hoping to become friends with. After the movie, they are all saying how great it was, but you thought the movie was awful. Do you say that? No. Instead, you agreed with everyone else and said you liked it. And why? Not because you think the movie was good, you just want to get along with the group. If you say you thought that movie was lousy, you might seem, oh, like you’re not part of the group. So this is an instance of normative influence.
