1. What is the main purpose of the lecture?
  A) To describe the discovery of a previously unknown written language
  B) To explain a debate among researchers about the origin of an ancient script
  C) To introduce a method that could be useful in deciphering unknown writing systems
  D) To emphasize the similarities among different ancient languages

2. What did researchers initially assume about the Ugaritic tablets? [choose two answers]
  A) The language represented in the text was similar to ancient Hebrew.
  B) The individual symbols in the texts represented words.
  C) The combinations of symbols consisted mostly of names.
  D) The symbols in the text were alphabetic.

3. Why does the professor discuss the discovery of five axes?
  A) To explain their role in helping researchers to decipher the Ugaritic script
  B) To provide evidence of a trade relationship between Ugaritic and Hebrew cultures
  C) To emphasize the disadvantages of using the traditional approach to deciphering scripts
  D) To show how one incorrect alphabet mapping can slow the entire deciphering process

4. According to the professor, what assumptions does the computer program make about the two scripts it compares? [choose two answers]
  A) Words represented by each script will share a similar structure.
  B) Each script is related to a third, known script.
  C) The order of words in a sentence will be similar in each script.
  D) Corresponding letters will occur a similar number of times in each script.

5. How does the professor respond when the student points out a limitation of the computer program? (no recording)
  A) She agrees that the traditional approach is preferable in some cases.
  B) She explains how the limitation was discovered.
  C) She points out that the limitation exists for all current approaches to deciphering a script
  D) She praises the student for identifying a limitation she had never considered.
