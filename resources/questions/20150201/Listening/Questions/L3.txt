1.	What are the speakers mainly discussing?
A.	Damage to crops resulting from chemicals produced by super weeds.
B.	Challenges associated with developing effective herbicides for super weeds
C.	Advantages and disadvantages of using herbicides in minimum-till farming
D.	Research investigating why weeds grow more quickly among certain crops

2.	Why does the professor discuss the minimum-till farming method?
A.	To suggest that this method is most useful in small gardens
B.	To question whether this method is environmentally responsible
C.	To indicate an efficient method for removing super weeds from field
D.	To support her point about the importance of controlling super weeds

3.	What was the goal of the research study that the professor describes?
A.	To develop a way to grow crops that are resistant to 2,4-D
B.	To create a new herbicide that is more effective than  glyphosate
C.	To identify two of the bacterial enzymes that are present in 2,4-D
D.	To understand why certain plants are particularly vulnerable to herbicides


4.	What does the professor say about the corn and soybean plants that were used in the experiment?
A.	They were treated with 2,4-D in fields, but not in greenhouses
B.	They were less productive than the researchers had expected them to be
C.	They were manipulated to produce protective bacterial enzymes
D.	They were selected for the experiment because they are more easily damaged by 2,4-D than by glyphosate.
