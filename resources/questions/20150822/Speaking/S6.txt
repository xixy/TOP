So insects have various ways to communicate with each other, and, uh, one way is by releasing special chemicals into the air, chemicals called pheromones. Now, these chemicals, or pheromones, send information to other insects. What happens is, an insect releases a pheromone, a chemical message, into the air, and other insects are able to sense it and, uh, basically get information from it. Let's look at two ways that insects use pheromones to communicate, uh, to send information. Okay, so one way insects use pheromones, is to communicate location to help them find their way home like, uh, take bees. Bees sometimes travel long distances away from their hive to find food, so how do they find their way back home, back to the hive? Well, this is where pheromones come in. Bees back at the hive release a pheromone into the air, and the bees out looking for food sense this pheromone and recognize it as belonging to their hive. In this way, the bees back at the hive communicate the location of the hive to the bees out finding food, and the bees out finding food are able to find their way back by following this signal, the pheromone, back home. Insects also use pheromones to announce that theyâ€™re ready to mate. For example, the moth does this. See, when a female moth is ready to reproduce, to mate, she releases a pheromone. This pheromone travels through the air and is sensed by male moths. The pheromone tells them that there is a female who is ready to mate and where she is. The males get this information from the pheromone released by the female, so they go to where the female is and mate with her.
