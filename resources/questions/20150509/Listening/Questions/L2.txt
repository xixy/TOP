1.	What is the lecture mainly about?
A.	The effect of the tidal flow on the salt marsh
B.	Ways that some plants have adapted to living in salt marshes
C.	The process of osmoses in plants
D.	Differences between plants that grow in salt marshes and plants that grow elsewhere

2.	What is one result of reverse osmosis in the spartina?
A.	Salt from seawater strengthens the plant's cells.
B.	All parts of the plant are able to receive oxygen.
C.	Salt evaporates off the stems and leaves of the plant.
D.	Water is unable to move across the plant cell walls.

3.	Why does the professor mention reddish mud on the roots of a spartina?
A.	To illustrate the high density of salt-marsh soil
B.	To explain how spartina rhizomes move through the soil
C.	To point out the problems spartinas face in getting fresh water
D.	To provide evidence that oxygen is present in the spartinasâ€˜ roots

4.	In what way are rhizomes important for spartinas?
A.	They allow plants to remain cool in direct sunlight
B.	They reduce the possibility of plants being uprooted during storms
C.	They help plants in dense soil process oxygen.
D.	They reduce the concentration of salt in the surrounding seawater.
 
5.	What can be inferred about the process that prevents spartinas from breaking in violent storms?
A.	It is the same process that helps them survive being immersed in saltwater.
B.	The process is also responsible for causing their air tubes to form.
C.	The process sometimes damages their rhizomes.
D.	Many other plants have developed a similar process.

6.	Why does the professor say this?
A.	To point out an incorrect conclusion
B.	To clarify the meaning of a term
C.	To admit that there is little evidence of the phenomenon she just described
D.	To emphasize the difference between a fact and an opinion
