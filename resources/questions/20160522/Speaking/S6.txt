Listen to part of a talk in a Business class.

(female professor) Businesses want to establish and maintain loyal customers of course, customers who will return again and again to purchase their products or services. Besides the obvious financial advantages, you might be surprised to know that there are other benefits of having loyal customers. Let’s talk about two of these benefits.

For one thing, loyal customers are likely to spread positive information about the business. When customers are loyal to a business and think its products or services are high quality, they’re likely to tell others. And this can help attract new customers. Take the example of someone who always goes to the same car mechanic to have her car fixed because she’s happy with the service. Well, when her friend’s car needs repairs, she may tell the friend about that mechanic shop and the friend may go there, too. And then the friend may tell her friends about it as well.

Now, another benefit of loyal customers is that they’re likely to engage in what researchers call “helpful customer behavior” while at the business. This means they take small actions that are helpful to the business just because they feel loyal to the business. For example, well, actually, I did this a few days ago. I was at my favorite bookstore and I overheard another customer telling his wife that he wondered if this bookstore sold history books. I knew it did so I jumped in and directed them to the history section of the bookstore.
