Control Animals

It is beneficial for animals that live in groups to maintain social harmony within the group such that group members live together peacefully and avoid conflicts or fights. If some members behave in a manner that disrupts group harmony, it is in the group's best interest to stop them from doing so. Thus, in some species, each group will have an animal that intervenes to stop conflicts or prevent disruptive behavior. This is the control animal. Not only does the control animal stop the behavior, but it may take actions to prevent the animals involved from becoming disruptive in the future.

(male professor) So, this has been observed in many species of monkeys, like, one species that lives in Asia, the Japanese macaque. With these monkeys, they live in pretty big groups. Sometimes there are hundreds of them. They live and sleep and eat together. And they work together to watch for predators and find food, so it's important that they get along OK.

But, they don't always get along, like, if one monkey wants a piece of food that another monkey has, it might start attacking the other monkey, hitting it and knocking aggressively to try and get the food. And if this were to continue, things could get out of control. So, instead, what happens is the monkey that's getting attacked would scream and make loud noises.

Well, there's another monkey in the group, usually it's the same monkey every time, that when it hears this screaming, rushes over to where the two monkeys are fighting and it gets between them to push them apart and break up the fight. And then that same monkey that ended the fight may also go a step further. It may hit or scream at the monkey that started the fight so it'll be less likely to start a fight again.

Explain how the example from the lecture illustrates the concept of control animals.
