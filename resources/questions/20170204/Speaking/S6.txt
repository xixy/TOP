(female professor) So, thousands of years ago, early humans first learned to use and control fire. Fire helped improve their quality of life in various ways. In fact, it made it easier for early people to survive. So, let's talk about a couple of advantages that people got from using fire.

One advantage of being able to control fire is that it allowed early humans to make better stone tools. Before people used fire, their stone tools weren't very sharp and they didn't last that long. But by using fire to heat the stones, they could make tools that were sharper and stronger, which made them more useful for hunting. For example, early humans would heat rocks in fire to a very high temperature. And this would make it easier for them to chip or break off pieces and make sharp edges on a stone, for example to make a knife blade. And they could use these sharp stone blades to hunt more effectively.

The second advantage of controlling fire is that it improved the quality of people's diet. Heating plant food, you know, vegetables, makes it softer and easier to eat. But it also allowed people to get more energy, because cooking can increase the available calories of some vegetables. For example, take potatoes. When they are raw, they are not easy for humans to digest, you know, for their bodies to process the food. But after they've been heated, potatoes become easier to digest, so people can absorb more of the calories, so using fire to cook potatoes allowed people to get more energy from eating them.
