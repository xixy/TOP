Stop Serving Junk Food in Dining Hall
The university's dining hall currently offers many healthy foods but also a lot of unhealthy snacks and junk food, like cookies and potato chips. I think the university should stop serving the unhealthy items and offer only healthier options, like fruits and vegetables. Students would benefit from the change in two ways. First, they'd be healthier, because they'd be eating lots of nutritious food. Also, students would save money. Many students buy unhealthy snacks and desserts, like ice cream, even if they're full after a meal but with the new plan, they will no longer waste money on food that they really don't need.
Sincerely, Mary Jacobs
