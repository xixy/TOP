4.What do the ice-dam theory and the meteor-impact theory both assume?
A)That all vegetation died during the Younger Dryas
B)That melting ice caused the Younger Dryas
C)That the Younger Dryas contributed to modern-day global warming
D)That the element iridium played a key role in the Younger Dryas

5.Why does the professor mention a cloud of dust? [choose two answers]
A)To explain how the North Atlantic conveyor belt works
B)To provide evidence for a decrease in temperature at the beginning of the Younger Dryas
C)To emphasize the speed at which climate change can occur
D)To explain how iridium deposits worldwide relate to one theory about the Younger Dryas

6.Why does the professor say this: 
A)To point out an apparent inconsistency with one of the proposed theories
B)To ask the students to think of an answer that is not presented in the textbook
