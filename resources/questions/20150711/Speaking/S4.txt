Environment Scenting
Our powerful sense of smell allows us to tell the difference between many kinds of odors. These odors are interpreted and processed in a part of the brain that affects our emotions, behavior, and memory. Given this knowledge, market researchers are studying the effects of what is known as environment scenting. This technique attempts to use pleasant fragrances to increase customer sales. The results of these marketing studies indicate that smells can strongly influence consumers both in their willingness to buy a product and in the value they place on a product.

OK, so, to see how this works, let's look at the result of an experiment conducted by researchers in a department store. They put a fragrance that had been proven to appeal to women into the air of a women's clothing department of a large store. Then, they put a different fragrance that had been proven to appeal to men into the air of the men's clothing department of the store. Well, the results were pretty surprising. Sales almost doubled on the days when these fragrances were used, so there really was a difference. Now, let's look at another experiment. In this one, two identical pairs of running shoes were each placed in separate rooms. One room was scented with a pleasant fragrance, and the other room had no fragrance at all. Then consumers were asked to enter each room and to examine each pair of shoes. Afterward, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire evaluating the shoes. Not only did most consumers prefer the shoes in the fragrant room, but they also thought the pair of shoes in the fragrant room was more expensive, ten dollars more than the pair of shoes in the room with no fragrance.
