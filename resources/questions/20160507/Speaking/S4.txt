Dimorphism

In many animal species, all the members of the species look similar to one another. However, in some species, certain members within the species look very different from others, displaying differences in color, size, and shape, which may correspond with varies survival needs. This phenomenon is known as dimorphism. One type of dimorphism involves male and female animals that look distinct from each other. Animals of the two genders may perform these roles more effectively.

Now listen to part of a lecture in a Biology class.

(male professor) So, there’s a type of bird they call birds of paradise and they are good example of this. The male birds of paradise have these really vibrant bright-colored feathers. They can be red, yellow, blue, green, and their feathers are large, too. So, these large, brightly colored feathers really stand out and draw attention to the male birds.

Now, the female birds of paradise, they have smaller feathers and their feathers are just dull shades of grey and brown. They don’t stand out. And for the male birds, their main concern is to mate with as many females as possible. They want to attract a lot of mates and these brightly colored feathers help them do this. Female birds pay attention to the male bird’s impressive feathers, so female birds are more likely to choose these male birds as mates.

But, the female birds, they sit on the nests and raise the young by themselves. And because female bird’s feathers are grey and brown, they blend in with the nest and the surroundings, and so the female birds are less likely to be noticed by dangerous predators while they’re sitting on the nest and taking care of the young birds. So their dull-colored feathers help keep the mother birds and the young birds safe.
