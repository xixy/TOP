Image Advertising
When companies advertise a product, they depend on the use of images as well as words to achieve their goal of increasing sales. An image can be a symbol, character, or design any visual figure or representation that will link the company with their product in the consumer's mind. Typically the image is a positive, entertaining one that consumers enjoy so much that it makes them want to buy the product in the future. The image also tends to be easy to remember even though it is usually something not normally or logically associated with the product.

You know, there are lots of different companies out there that make and sell cookies or biscuits. But there's one company, they bear cookies, that is, use this technique to sell more cookies than all its competitors. How? Well the company has this animal character called big bear that is used in all of its advertising. The picture of the bear is on its cookie boxes, and the character of the bear also appears in its TV commercial. Oh, and of course, the cookies themselves are shaped like big bear. Now, most people who eat big bear cookies are children. And well, they enjoy the bear and think it is really entertaining and fun. In the TV commercial for example, he's always saying funny things and dancing around in a wildly comical way, so big bear makes children feel good about the company's cookie, makes them want to get them. And you know the real interesting thing is that the figure of big bear stays in people's minds and makes them think of cookies even though bears don't usually have anything to do with cookies. I mean, bears certainly don't bake or eat cookies, right? Yet, big bear is a character that people- particularly children-don't seem to forget, because year after year, the big bear cookies sell more cookies than any other companies.
