You Too Fallacy

When someone is offered advice or a suggestion, that person may disagree with the advice and reject it. One reason people may disagree with the advice is that they think that if the person offering it does not follow his or her own advice, the advice itself must be wrong. This way of thinking is called the you too fallacy. Advice, however, may be good or helpful even if the person offering the advice does not follow it. People who commit the you too fallacy are making a mistake in reasoning, since they do not evaluate whether the advice itself may be good.

Now listen to part of a lecture in a Philosophy class

(male professor) OK, so, for example, I recently had a conversation with my brother. He’d been complaining lately that he doesn’t have much energy and hasn’t been feeling that great. He's been tired a lot. Now, my brother is someone who doesn’t pay much attention to what he eats. He eats a lot of sugary food and snacks and doesn’t eat many vegetables or other nutritious food. So, I suggested it might be a good idea for him to cut back on sugary shacks and eat healthier items like vegetables and more fruit to see if his energy improves. 

And I mentioned to him that I recently read an article in the newspaper about how eating a healthy diet with lots of fresh vegetables and nutritious food can actually give you more energy and doing the opposite, eating lots of junk food, can make you feel tired. Well, my brother didn’t believe it. He said he thought what I was saying was silly because he’d seen me eat junk food and desserts on various occasions and because I don’t always eat a healthy diet myself. So he probably wasn’t going to change his habit even though eating healthier foods probably would have helped him.
