Scientists have noticed that female animals that are mothers are better at finding food than those that don’t have young. They think it's because the females’ mental abilities improve when they become mothers. In particular, research has found that the mother's memory actually improves, which makes her better at caring for her young, better at finding food for her young. What's the evidence for this? Well, scientists did an experiment with mother rats and rats that weren’t mothers – non-mother rats – and they built a maze. Object was for the rats to find their way through the network of paths in order to get to the food at the end. The rats had to explore a bit because only one path in the maze led to the food. What the scientists were interested in was the speed. They tested the time it took the rats to find the food. And it turns out that mother rats were faster and spent less time finding their way through the maze than non-mother rats. Mother rats were much better at remembering which places in the maze they had already checked. They didn’t waste time with taking the same wrong turns or returning to the same dead end over and over. What did scientists learn from this? Well, they concluded that these enhanced mental abilities help the mother care for her young in the wild. With her improved memory, a mother is faster at finding food in the woods, fields, wherever she and her young are living. Because she can remember where the best places are to look, so she’ll spend less time, less time searching. This is good for the survival of her young because it means she’ll be able to get back to her nest faster to protect her young which are vulnerable to be attacked by predators when she's away.
