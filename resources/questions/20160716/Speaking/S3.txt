Get Rid of Food Carts

Currently, food vendors sell food to students from carts located outside the student center. In order to maintain a clean campus, I think the university should ban the carts. The cart area is very unsightly because students leave trash – paper wrappers, napkins, and even food scraps – on the ground. Additionally, getting rid of the food carts would benefit students’ health. Food carts serve a lot of junk food and without the carts, students will have to eat in the dining hall, where they can enjoy healthy foods, like soups and salads.
Sincerely,
Jack Parker

Now listen to two students discussing the letter.

(woman) I don’t agree with Jack's proposal.
(man) Really? Anything that’ll help clean up that area sounds good to me.
(woman) Well, yeah, but you can’t blame the food carts. Did you notice that there aren’t any garbage cans outside the student center?
(man) There aren’t?
(woman) No, putting some garbage receptacles in that area would be an easy way to solve the problem
(man) And it's not as drastic a solution as getting rid of the carts
(woman) Right, and you know, I don’t agree with Jack's opinion about the food, either. 
(man) Well, the dining hall does offer healthy choices.
(woman) Sure it does, but you know, the carts offer a lot more than hot dogs and pizza. Some stuff is good for you. They have fruit and juice.
(man) That's true.
(woman) I stop at one all the time and grab an apple or granola bar or something. This way when I am in class, I can concentrate on class, not on being hungry.
(man) So, you don’t think people would be healthier if they had to eat in the dining room?
(woman) No, actually, I don’t.
