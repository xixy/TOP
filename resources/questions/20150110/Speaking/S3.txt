University to Match Roommates Based on Interests

After  many  years  of  matching  first-year  students  with  dormitory  roommates  at random, the university will now try to assign roommates based on similar interests. Before they arrive on campus, all incoming students will fill out a questionnaire about their likes and dislikes and their habits. By matching students with similar interests  and  habits,  the  school  hopes  to  improve  the  experience  of  first--┸year students, who will now be more likely to get along well with their roommates. The plan will also reduce work for the housing office because fewer students will ask to switch rooms in the middle of the school year.

Man: You know, this makes so much sense. I wonder why it took them so long.
Woman: Oh, I don’t think it makes sense.
Man: Why not?
Woman: Well, I don’t think you need to have similar interests to make friends. Look at my roommate and me. We’re completely different. I mean, she’s a French major and I’m studying biochemistry. She’s really into sports and I, well, let’s just say I’m not very athletic.
Man: Yeah, but you guys are good friends.
Woman: Exactly, that’s my point, we get along great. 
Man: I see. But you have to admit there are a lot of cases where…
Woman: Yeah, I know, cases where people decide they have to move out, but, well nobody moves out just because they don’t have the same interests as their roommate. Maybe they have very different schedules or…
Man: Or, they have a chance to move to a better location.
Woman: Yeah. Anyway, my point is that there’s no reason to expect a big drop, people are still going to want to move
Man: For all kinds of reasons.
