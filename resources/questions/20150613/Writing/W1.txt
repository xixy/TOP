In the United States, a new law has been proposed to restrict the importing, buying, and selling of nonnative species of animals. Over the last few decades, nonnative species such as pythons and snakehead fish were brought into the country by animal breeders and then escaped or were released into the wild, causing serious environmental problems. The law's intention is to prevent such environmental disruptions. There are, however, several reasons to oppose such a law.

The first criticism is that the law might be used to force pet owners to turn their pets over to authorities. Many household pets, such as parakeets and hamsters, are not native species. Pet owners are concerned that under the new law, it may be decided that their pets constitute an environmental threat. People fear that their pets will be taken away from them by authorities, even though the pets are kept safely indoors and have done no actual harm.

Second, opponents also complain that the law will be very expensive to implement. The law requires that a study be done on every nonnative species brought into the country. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the animal would damage the environment if it escaped into the wild. Thousands of nonnative species are brought into the United States, meaning that millions of dollars will have to be spent on safety studies.

Third, opponents complain that the law is unreasonable because it applies a single standard to the entire country. It fails to recognize regional differences within the United States. Opponents argue, for example, that tropical nonnative animals like Brazilian rabbits would pose little threat in the northern part of the United States because it is too cold in those areas for the rabbits to become established and breed. Any law so broad, opponents argue, is unfair.
