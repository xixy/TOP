In paragraph 5, why does the author include the information that broken pieces of pottery often provided "clues to Neolithic communities" ?   A) To provide an example of remains that archeologists use to infer a shift to domestication   B) To explain how archaeologists have been able to identify the purpose of storage structures at Neolithic sites   C) To explain how archaeologists discovered that Neolithic peoples had to invent ways to store agricultural crops   D) To support the claim that food-processing artifacts are more commonly found at Neolithic than at Paleolithic sites10. Paragraph 5 mentions all of the following as true of the Neolithic peoples EXCEPT:   A) They engaged in the production of food in settled communities.   B) They frequently searched for new herds in order to domesticate animals.   C) They used new methods for processing and storing food crops.   D) They made clay pots that they used to cook and store food.12. Look at the four squares [ï‚¢] that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.   This involves taking several relevant factors into account.   Where would the sentence best fit?13. Prose Summary   Most of our knowledge of both plant and animal domestication comes from the archaeological record.   Answer Choices:   A) Information about differences between domesticated plant species and wild species has increased greatly in recent years as a result of a technique known as flotation.   B) The presence of domesticated plants can often be determined from studying remains found at archaeological sites, but it is much more difficult to distinguish between domesticated and wild animals.   C) Archaeologists look for signs of human influence on wild animal populations as an indication of the beginnings of domestication, but evidence for such influence can be problematic.   D) Paleolithic hunters in Southwest Asia killed both wild goats and sheep for food, but later peoples began to prefer hunting sheep, often capturing animals to be killed and eaten at a later time.   E) Large and small storage structures made from many different materials have been found at Neolithic sites demonstrating the resourcefulness of the inhabitants of the sites.   F) The shift from hunting and gathering to domestication is sometimes inferred from food-processing artifacts, but such indirect evidence as the presence of pottery, does not, by itself, guarantee that shift.
