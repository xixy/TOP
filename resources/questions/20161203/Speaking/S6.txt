Listen to part of a talk in an Ecology class

(female professor) Now, we know that trees reproduce through seeds. But before seeds can sprout and grow into new trees, they have to pass through an important phase, the phase called dormancy. A seed that's dormant is basically not active. So during the dormancy phase, seeds don’t sprout and grow. They’re able to lie dormant. They wait until the environmental conditions are right for them to grow. But what happens when humans want to grow trees, like, for an orchard or to replant a forest? They need to find a way to imitate nature that they need to speed up the process and end seed dormancy sooner so the seeds would sprout.

One method of ending dormancy involves imitating the temperature conditions, the weather the seeds normally experience in nature. In some climates, seeds fall from trees in early winter and lie dormant on the ground where it's cold and damp for the rest of the winter until warmer temperatures arrive in spring. So when humans want to grow those trees, in order to end the seeds’ dormancy, they need to expose seeds to similar temperatures. For example, people may refrigerate the seeds of the oak tree for a few months before planting them in warmer soil. The cool moist environment of the refrigerator recreates the natural conditions of winter for the oak seeds.

Also humans many need to break down a seed's hard outer coating to end the dormancy period. Many seeds have a protective covering that normally gets worn away over time by natural forces like water. But humans have developed ways to break or remove the outer coating to make seeds sprout faster. Um, for example, with seeds from the locust tree, people can put them in a can and shake them for several minutes, which scratches the coating away, allowing the locust seeds to sprout.
