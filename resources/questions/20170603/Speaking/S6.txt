(female professor) Now, there are different reasons why a business may not do well financially. Sometimes people are simply not interested in the products it offers. But other times a business may not be profitable because of problems within its own organization. Such problems coming from inside a business are sometimes called internal business constraints, because they constrain or limit the business from doing as well as it could. And it¡¯s important for a business to know what internal constraints may be holding it back so that it can address them, improve, and increase its profits.
So, some internal constraints are problems with physical resources and by that I mean problems with equipment and machines that a business uses. A business needs to know if it doesn¡¯t have the right equipment or if there are problems with how the equipment functions, because otherwise the business can¡¯t operate efficiently. For example, consider cash registers at a supermarket. If customers go to buy items and the store is using old outdated cash registers, the process may take longer, which could lead to long lines of customers waiting. And some customers might get so annoyed that they don¡¯t return to that supermarket, which hurts the business.
Another internal business constraint comes from a lack of employee training. Employees must have adequate training to help the business achieve its goals. When employees don¡¯t have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their jobs well, it can harm the business. For example, say that supermarket¡¯s employees don¡¯t know where all of the store¡¯s products are located. If customers ask employees where to find certain products, and employees direct them to the wrong location in the store, customers may leave without buying anything.
