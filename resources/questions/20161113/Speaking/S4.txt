Adjustable Group Size

Animals often group together for survival purposes. Some animal groups maintain a constant number of members even under changing circumstances. However, some animal species exhibit adjustable group size, which means the number of group members changes temporarily in response to different types of survival challenges the animals face. A group of a certain size may help protect animals from threats to their safety. But the same animals may need to form a group of a different size in order to effectively obtain resources.

(male professor) OK, we can see this with monkeys, with baboons specifically. Now, at night, when baboons are resting, there are usually a lot of them gather together, sometimes hundreds. OK? Now, imagine there’s a predator nearby, like a lion. With a big group of baboons resting together, there’s really a good chance that at least one of them will notice the lion trying to sneak up on them. And then that baboon can alert all the others; warn them the lion’s coming, whereas, you know, if there were just one baboon or a few of them, it’d be easier for the lion to sneak up on them unnoticed.

But, during the day, when the baboons need to search for food, they usually separate into smaller groups, anywhere from a few to about twenty baboons. You see, baboons eat the flowers from a certain type of tree and sometimes these trees are spread pretty far apart in the forest. Since the foods are not all in one place, and there’s only a limited number of flowers on any one tree, it makes more sense for the baboons to spread out in smaller groups.

Using the example of baboons, explain how adjustable group size benefits animals.
