Time to Improve the University Grounds

I’m writing to propose that the university consider setting aside one day each semester for cleaning up the university grounds. This is needed because the campus is unattractive in certain areas right now, with bits of trash and litter on the lawns and old posters cluttering up signposts and bulletin boards. To accomplish the cleaning, the university could use student volunteers. The students could be organized into small groups that would go around campus picking up trash and removing the old posters.
Sincerely,
Jim Smith

Now listen to two students discussing the letter.

(man) So what do you think about that proposal, Mary?
(woman) I don’t know; doesn’t seem necessary to me.
(man) You don’t think so?
(woman) No, I mean, first of all, I think he's exaggerating about how bad it looks.
(man) Yeah?
(woman) Yeah, I mean, sure, there's some stuff that ends up on the ground. That's gonna happen in a big university. But it's not really as bad as he makes it sound, especially considering how many students cross campus every day.
(man) Yes, I guess on the whole it's pretty clean.
(woman) I certainly don’t think it's a problem. And even those posters, they get taken down every so often when people put up new ones. It never gets totally out of control.
(man) Right
(woman) Plus, even if it did look bad, I don’t it should be us dealing with the problem.
(man) Well, it wouldn’t be a requirement for students to
(woman) Yeah, but even so, we’re here to study and take classes and work on our academic goals not to this kind of thing.
(man) That's true.
(woman) If this were really a problem, then professionals should be hired to do it, people who would get paid to do the work.

#question
The woman expresses her opinion about the student's proposal. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state her opinion and explain the reasons she gives for holding that opinion.
