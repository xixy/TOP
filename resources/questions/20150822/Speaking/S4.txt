Bi-directionality
When studying children's early social development, it is normal to focus on the parents' influence on their children. However, this focus gives an incomplete picture of the parent-child relationship and its influence on the child's development. Bi-directionality is a principle that states that the relationship between children and their parents is a reciprocal, or two-way, relationship: parents influence their children, and children influence their parents. More specifically, the way children behave influences the way their parents respond, and the way parents respond to their children's behavior affects the way the children behave in the future. The two-way, or bidirectional, nature of this relationship plays an important role in children's personal development.

Okay, so, an example that illustrates this principle. Let's say we have two parents, and these parents have a 6-month-old baby. A baby boy named Max. Max is a happy baby. He smiles a lot, he loves to be held, he makes a lot of babbling noises in an attempt to communicate with his parents. Now, Max's behaviors are going to affect the way his parents respond to him. Because Max smiles a lot, his parents are going to smile back at him. He likes to be held, so, his parents will spend more time holding him. And because Max babbles a lot, or tries to communicate, his parents will spend more time talking to him. So, in general, Max's behavior is going to lead his parents to have a lot of interaction with him. In turn, his parents’ response, their increased social interaction, will affect Max's future behavior, by socializing with him, by providing him with extra attention and nurturing, they’ll encourage him to smile even more, to seek out even more physical contact, to try to communicate with his parents even more.
