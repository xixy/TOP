The  British  Library  owns  a  fourteenth-century  handwritten  book  containing  four poems considered to be among the finest of the English Middle Ages. The unknown author is referred to as the Pearl Poet after the title of one of the poems in the manuscript. Several theories have been put forward about the Pearl Poet's identity.

John Massey
One theory suggests that the Pearl Poet was John Massey. John was known to have lived in northwest England, where the poems of the Pearl manuscript were produced. Moreover, the surviving manuscript of John's poem, Saint Erkenwald, is in the same handwriting as the British Library's manuscript of the poems of the Pearl Poet. These facts make a good argument that the Pearl Poet was John Massey.

Hugh
According  to  a  second  theory,  the  fourteenth-century  poet  known  as  little  Hugh authored the poems. Historical records indicate that Hugh wrote a poem called The Adventure of Gawain, which some have hypothesized is the same as one of the four Pearl Poet poems, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The poems of the Pearl Poet make extensive use of alliteration pairs of adjacent words that begin with the same consonant sound (for example, large lake) and it is known that Hugh wrote alliterative verse. The shared subject matter and use of alliteration support the identity of Hugh as the Pearl Poet.

No single author
A third theory argues that the four poems in the manuscript were in fact written by several authors rather than a single one. The only thing all the poems have in common is that they mention places in the same region of England. So perhaps the manuscript represents a collection of poems by several authors from the same region.
