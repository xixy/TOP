Energy-Saving Challenge

Next month a contest will be held among all of the campus residence halls to determine which dormitory can use the least amount of electricity. The university will monitor power usage in all dormitories ，and the students of the dormitory that uses the least electricity in the month will be announced as the winners . One goal of the contest is to increase students' awareness of energy use，and it is hoped that this will lead to a decrease in electricity consumption. In the following month，students in the winning dormitory will be awarded a pizza pay catered by a popular local restaurant.

Now listen to two students discussing the article.
Woman: James, have you seen this article?
Man: Yea, what do you think about it?
Woman: I think kits a pretty cool idea, actually.
Man: Do you think it will work?
Woman: Yea, I do. We all waste a lot of energy, but maybe this will help us to find ways to remind ourselves, like everyone could post a little note on their door as a reminder to turn off lights and we see the lights whenever we leave our rooms.
Man: Yea, that could help, but do you think everyone is going to want to get involved? I mean, do you think most students really care about considering energy?
Woman: Well, I'm not sure about everyone, but I do know that most students get excited when they hear of an opportunity to get delicious food for free.
Man: Yea, you're right about that.
Woman: So even if some students aren't that serious about the issue, I think they'll be interested in enjoying the reward.
