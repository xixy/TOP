Listen to part of a lecture in a Marketing class

(female professor) So, in order to attract customers, businesses have to show that the product or service they’re selling is good. And businesses which sell a service, you know, something they do for people, sometimes have a hard time with this, because it's hard for customers to know if the service is good without trying it. So these service businesses need to provide some sort of evidence to show that their service is high quality and can be trusted and it's possible to provide this evidence of the quality of their service in their advertising.

One thing service businesses can do is provide testimonials in their ads. A testimonial is a written or spoken statement from a customer about the quality of the service. Here's an example. I have a friend who's a painter. He paints houses. When my friend first started his business, he was having trouble getting business because people didn’t know if they could trust his work. They’ve never used his service before. So he asked some of his past customers to write a few words about what they thought of his service and they wrote nice things, like, “his painting looked great,” “it lasted a long time,” “he worked quickly,” “the price was good,” and so on. My friend could then put these testimonials in his advertising and this helped him get more customers.

My friend also provided another kind of evidence for the quality of his service in his advertising: before and after photos of the work he did. In the ad, he put a photograph of an old house with bad paint before he worked on it, then another photo beside it of the same house after he painted it and the house looked great, so potential customers could see with their own eyes that his work was good.
