(female professor) So, for animals that live in the desert, the harsh climate with dry, often extremely hot weather creates certain challenges, of course. One challenge is food scarcity. There’s not much food in the desert, because it’s difficult for most plants and animals to live there. So food tends to be scarce. There’s not much to eat. So animals that live in the desert have some special adaptations for food scarcity.

First of all, desert animals may have to travel a lot to find enough food. So, some desert animals have physical adaptations that make it easier for them to search a lot of ground without using as much energy, enabling the animal to move more efficiently, so it can cover more ground with less energy. For example, desert kangaroos move by jumping or hopping through the large areas they need to search, to find the plants they eat. Hopping or jumping creates momentum that helps move the kangaroo forward as it hops. And so, it takes less energy than just running around the area would.

Also, some desert animals had adaptations that allow them to store extra food in their bodies. If they find extra food, they can eat it and store it as fat reserves in their bodies. So when food becomes scarce, the body can convert the fat to energy allowing the animal to survive until it finds food again. For example, certain lizards in the desert, if they find food, like eggs or small animal, they’ll eat as much as possible. And the extra food will be stored as fat in the lizard’s tail, which could actually double in size after a large meal. And then, if the lizard has to go without food for a while, it can live off the extra fat in its tail.
