Listen to a conversation between two students.

(woman) Hey John, I'm so excited about the free performance our singing group will be giving this weekend, is everything ready?
(man) Yeah, we're all set for the performance, there's just one problem.
(woman) Uh oh, what is it?
(man) Well, I was gonna put a big announcement in the newspaper this week, you know, to make sure people know about the performance cause we really want a lot of people to come.
(woman) That's great! The newspaper is where everyone checks for events on campus.
(man) Yeah, that's the thing, I accidentally missed the deadline to submit the announcement so the announcement isn't in the newspaper and now I'm worried nobody's gonna come hear us sing.
(woman) Oh, that's a shame! We've been practicing so much. You know, if we move the show to next weekend you'd have time to get the announcement into the newspaper.
(man) Yeah, I thought about changing the date, that way more people would be aware of the performance.
(woman) Sounds easy enough.
(man) Not really, it took so long to book the music hall. If we change the date we might have to find a new location. The music hall was only available this weekend.
(woman) Oh, so changing the date wouldn't be as easy as I thought. What else? Hmm, well, you could put up posters everywhere so more people know about it.
(man) Oh that's an idea! If I do that today, enough people might see the poster so they'll know about the performance.
(woman) Yeah, I know I sometimes find out about events by reading posters.
(man) Uh, I just hope people will see them in time to make plans to come hear us sing.
