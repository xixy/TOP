Prose Summary   The phi phenomenon and persistence of vision are two characteristics of the human perceptual system that make motion pictures and television possible.   Answer Choices:   A) When the persistence of vision became widely known, it inspired the development of toys that made hand-drawn pictures appear to move.   B) The motion-picture camera developed from the experiments in sequential photography that were originally done by Edward Muybridge.   C) The invention of the motion-picture camera led to the discovery that a horse's feet do not leave the ground while the horse is galloping.   D) Later developments in film included a focus on large-screen projection rather than individual viewing machines and narrative fiolms rather than simple action sequences.   E) The primary competitors in early motion-picture technology were Edison's Kinetoscope and the European-designed and manufactured large-screen projection devices.   F) French filmmakers Alice Guy-Blache and Georges Melies started the first two major movie studios in America and in France, respectively.
