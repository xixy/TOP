Campus Gym to Close for Renovations over Spring Break

The campus gym will be closed during the two-week spring break this year in order to allow time for minor renovations to improve the facilities and the exercise equipment. According to university officials, the renovations will occur during spring break to avoid causing any inconvenience to students, since many students will be away from campus during that time. However, outdoor facilities such as the running track, the tennis course, and the sports fields will still be open so students who do remain on campus and wish to exercise can use these facilities.

(man) Did you see this article, Kate?
(woman) Yeah, I did and I think it makes sense. It’s the perfect time.
(man) Sure, but aren’t some students are still around then?
(woman) Yeah, but the few who do stay on campus are usually, like, finishing a paper or research projects. So they’re really busy and probably wouldn’t go there anyway.
(man) Oh, I didn’t think of that.
(woman) I mean, last year I stayed to finish a project, I went there one day and there was no one else there.
(man) OK, but what about the people who do want to exercise?
(woman) Well, students can still exercise if they want to. The university seems like it’s gonna make sure there will still be options for them.
(man) Oh, that’s right, outside.
(woman) Right, and it’s the perfect time of the year to do that stuff anyway, because we all want to be outside.
(man) True, because the weather’s warm.
(woman) Exactly!
