Listen to part of a lecture from an Environmental Science class.

(female professor) So, we've been discussing agriculture. And as I was saying, in parts of the world where there's not a lot of rainfall, farmers rely on groundwater to water their crops. They get this groundwater from wells or ponds. Unfortunately, this creates a problem: groundwater contains a lot of salt. And so what happens is, over time, the salt from the groundwater can built up in the soil and create very poor growing conditions for crops. So farmers who depend on groundwater to water their crops need to find solutions for this problem of salt accumulation in the soil.

One way of dealing with salt accumulation is to prevent the salt from accumulating in the soil in the first place. And farmers can do that by preventing excess water from remaining in the fields after they water their crops. If farmers get the extra water out of their fields quickly, the salt won't have a chance to build up in the soil. For example, famers can set up a network of pipes, drainage pipes. And then when they water their crops, the excess water that isn't absorbed by the crops goes into the pipes and gets carried away from the fields. And when that water gets carried away, the salt gets carried away with it, so it doesn't accumulate in the fields.

Another way to address the problem is by making use of the land despite having high concentrations of salt in the soil. And farmers can do that by growing crops that are resistant to salt, crops that are able to grow in salty soil. For example, they can grow crops like beets. Unlike most crops, beets grow well in salty soil. Or they can grow date palms. Date palms also grow well in salty soil. And by growing crops like beets and date palms farmers can make use of their land even if the soil's very salty.
