  C) The impact of human activities on certain wildlife habitats
  D) Government policies on wildlife management

2. Why does the professor mention a bear?
  A) To indicate a species the researchers expected to identify
  B) To explain the variety of habitats where nests were collected
  C) To illustrate how animal hairs might end up in birds' nests
  D) To demonstrate why it is easier to collect nests than set traps

3. The professor explains the method the researchers in Hungary used in their study. What problems does she say the researchers were aiming to avoid? [choose two answers]

  B) Making nests unsuitable for future use by birds
  C) Leaving human footprints in forested areas
  D) Interfering with birds' raising of their young

4. What two unexpected results of the study does the professor mention? [choose two answers]
  A) Birds' nests were more commonly found in mountains than in plains.
  B) Hairs from deer and wild sheep were found in many nests.
  C) Some nests contained hairs from animals not normally found in the area.
  D) Only a few nests in a developed area contained hairs from domestic animals.

5. What does the professor imply about the nest collection method?
  A) It does not provide all the information that traditional methods do.
  B) It is less expensive than other hair-collection methods.
  C) It is potentially too invasive to be useful to researchers.
  D) It is most accurate when used in areas isolated from humans.

6. Why does the professor say this: 
  A) To express doubt about the effectiveness of the lab procedures
  B) To emphasize the importance of sanitizing the nests
  C) To find out what the students know about contamination
